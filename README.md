# MedMNIST
 2021 Spring Machine Learning Project (1)

### Guidelines

Directly run `mytrain.py`. Change the name of task and model by `data_name` and `model_name`. Change the dataset directory by `input_root`；`start_epoch` and `end_epoch` controls the stage of traning. Description can be seen in the code too.

`results` contains the output of resnet18 and resnet50.

`mymodel.py` under `medmnist` is the ResNet model modified by us.

The structure of the code references https://github.com/MedMNIST/MedMNIST

We made some improvements, including thresholds and losses.
